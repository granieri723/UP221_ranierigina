# UP221_ranierigina
I'm Gina, this is my first time trying coding. This will serve as my repository for UP-221 with Chris Giamarino. I hope to gain a working understanding of spatial data science to help complement my work in urban planning. My research focus is on climate resilience and adaptation, and I want to work on the relationship between urban growth and biodiversity. 
There is a known link between species richness and income. However, not all species are beneficial to the environment, and species may be invasive. I want to research the link between the occurrence of invasive plants and new development, particularly in the outskirts of SoCal.
iNaturalist if a community science repository that captures the incidence, rarity, and location of all types of species. I filtered by Plantae and to the Southern California region. https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=962&quality_grade=research&subview=table&iconic_taxa=Plantae
The California Department of Housing and Community Development reports on new construction and development of housing. Each jurisdiction prepares an annual report on new development activity. I plan to use the past five years of reporting in SoCal. https://www.hcd.ca.gov/planning-and-community-development/housing-element-implementation-and-apr-dashboard
